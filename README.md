Replace Tool:

In our VR projects, our artists needed a simple way to rename their objects en masse.  So I made a tiny tool that does a text search of node names and replaces it with a user supplied text.  If there are selections made, it will only apply to those that are selected.  If there is nothing selected, it replaces all matches.
